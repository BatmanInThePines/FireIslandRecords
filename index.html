    <h1>Fire Island Records</h1>
    <h2>Art. Sound. Signal.</h2>
    <p>
      Fire Island Records is an independent label born at the intersection of art, technology, and sound.
      From genre-bending house and ambient experiments to glam rock synth nostalgia and cinematic soundscapes,
      our catalog captures the pulse of an island that has always inspired freedom, individuality, and bold creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fueled by future-forward tools and a deep respect for analog roots, Fire Island Records supports artists and
      productions that defy convention, evoke mood, and move peopleâ€”on dance floors, in headphones, and everywhere in between.
